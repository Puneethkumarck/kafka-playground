Kafka producer-config
====================

- Important(Mostly Used) Producer Configs are 

   - <b>bootstrap.servers</b> -> A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.
   - <b>key.serializer</b> -> Serializer class for key that implements the <code>Serializer</code> interface.
   - <b>value.serializer</b> -> Serializer class for value that implements the <code>Serializer</code> interface.
   - <b>partitioner.class</b> -> Partitioner class that implements the <code>Partitioner</code> interface.
   - <b>retries</b> -> Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error.
     Allowing retries without setting <code>"MAX_IN_FLIGHT_REQUESTS_PER_CONNECTION"</code> to 1 will potentially change the ordering of records 
     because if two batches are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the records in the second 
     batch may appear first.
     
   - <b>max.in.flight.requests.per.connection</b> ->The maximum number of unacknowledged requests the client will send on a single connection before blocking.
        Note that if this setting is set to be greater than 1 and there are failed sends, there is a risk of message re-ordering due to retries (i.e., if retries are enabled).
   - <b>batch.size</b> ->The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition.
   - <b>linger.ms</b>->The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount "
       "of artificial delay&mdash;that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together
   - <b>acks</b>-> The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete.
       <ul>
                                           <li><code>acks=0</code> If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the
                                            server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be
                                            made that the server has received the record in this case, and the <code>retries</code> configuration will not
                                            take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will
                                            always be set to -1.
                                            <li><code>acks=1</code> This means the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond
                                            without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after
                                            acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost.
                                            <li><code>acks=all</code> This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to
                                            acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica
                                            remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. This is equivalent to the acks=-1 setting.

  - buffer.memory -> The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server.
  
  - compression.type -> The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none (i.e. no compression). Valid values are
    <code>none</code>, <code>gzip</code>, <code>snappy</code>, or <code>lz4</code>.Compression is of full batches of data, 
    so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression).
    
  - client.id -> An id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond 
     just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included in server-side request logging.
  - max.request.size -> The maximum size of a request in bytes. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record size.
